## Creating a world with Reality Protocol (based on AOS and Arweave)

This is a World project built based on [Reality Protocol](https://github.com/elliotsayes/Reality/tree/main/docs) . Refer to their guides for [World Guide](https://github.com/elliotsayes/Reality/blob/main/docs/WorldGuide.md) and [Agent Guide](https://github.com/elliotsayes/Reality/blob/main/docs/AgentGuide.md)

Prerequisites are to learn about:
1. [Arweave](https://cookbook.arweave.dev/)
2. [AOS](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/)

## Getting Started
First install AOS.

```bash 
npm i -g https://get_ao.g8way.io
```

Start the aos process by typing ```aos``` at the terminal:
```bash 
aos
```

Then load the files by running

```bash 
.load Reality.lua
.load WorldTemplate.lua
```
Copy your process ID (at the start of aos/type ao.id within the aos) and view it at the [Reality Viewer](https://reality-viewer.arweave.net/#/)
